# Shooter 2D

A point and click shooter game I made while learning Bevy.

The [Bevy CLI](https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy_cli) was used to create the initial template for the project.

---

To start the game, download the shooter_2d release package and run directly.

---

To start the game from source, while in the project directory, type into the terminal:

```
bevy run
```

or...

```
cargo run
```
